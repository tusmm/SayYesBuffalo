**Our system** will send out email reminders within a set period of time to all students who have been referred and/or applied via sent out links. For example, once a referral is made for a group of students, someone can enter in the students' emails to a Google Sheet and then export as a CSV to be used for an automated email to be sent in a set period of time (ie. 3 weeks).
